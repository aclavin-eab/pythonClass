The biggest problem I ran into was how to get the other windows to close when they weren't in the scope of the close, but creating an array with the objects in them allowed me to fix that. I also ran into some big issues with the Tk image thing, trying to see what I could do without the book's image.py class, i got pretty far with it, but ran into issues when one of my color list items was " ", even when i changed it to 0, it still just wouldn't run. The whole tk system seems to be really weird to me, but I probably just need to spend more time with it. But like, what is needed just to get an image to show up seems excessive.
